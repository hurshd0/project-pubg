### So, where we droppin' boys and girls? 
PUBG or Player Unknown Battlegrounds is a battle-royale style game where at the beginning of the play, nearly 100 people parachute onto an island without any equipment. In order to win the game, you need to scavenge for weapons and available equipment to eliminate the other people and survive to the end. The game also restricts player in Hunger Game style by reducing the playable are in map after a some amount of fixed time is passed.

### Objective

**Defining the problem:** The problem we have is, there is not set guide or strategy to improve player performance in PUBG, should your play style be stealth like a ninja and sneak upon unsuspecting players, or by camping in one spot and hide your way into victory, or snipe like assassin, or do you need to be aggressive and play like Rambo? 

**Solution:** Is to create a web application that allows players to improve their strategy by considering *What-if* scenarios as MVP.
